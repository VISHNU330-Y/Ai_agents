🛠️ AI Support Ticket Classifier

This project is an **AI-powered support ticket classifier**.
It uses **Google’s Gemini AI model** to read customer support tickets and classify them into:

 **Bug** 🐞
 **Feature Request** 💡
 **Question** ❓

It also suggests the **next steps** and saves all tickets into a **history file** for tracking.
